## Introduction

As a team we got together and thought about what we want our product to reflect for the team. It was decided that we want our team work and skills to be a part of our product since we are all passionate about engineering. The product will reflect our time management, team coordination, ideation, design, programming and the ability to put together a functional product.

The goal for the product is to be a mobile weather station that accurately responds to environmental changes in real-time. This will be done over WiFi using the MQTT protocal that will help ensure seemless access to information.
